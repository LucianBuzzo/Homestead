# Homestead

The players must work together to plant and harvest enough crops to survive the winter. If the players can collect enough food tokens by the end of the game, they win!

## You will need:

- Game board, consistent of a 10x10 grid of spaces
- Player tokens (one for each player)
- Crop tokens to represent the crops that are planted (dice can be used as crop tokens)
- one six-sided dice

## Gameplay

Players start by placing their tokens on the game the board.
The game is divided into rounds, and each round consists of every player taking a turn.

- When it's a player's turn, they roll a die to determine how many spaces they can move their token around the board. They can only move horizontally or vertically, and not diagonally.
- A player cannot finish their turn on a space that is already occupied by another player's token.
- Once per turn, a player can choose to
  a) plant a crop on a space that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to their token. Place a counter on that space to represent the crop.
  b) harvest a crop on a space that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to their token. Harvested crops go into the players' food pile, and the crop counter is removed from the board.
- A player can only plant one crop per turn.

## Weather & Crop Growth

Once every turn is complete, roll a dice, on a roll of 1-4, the weather is good and all crops grow normally. On a roll of 5-6, the weather is bad and crops do not grow.
The crop growth cycle is as follows:

- Sown: The crop has been planted this round
- Growing: The crop has started to grow
- Ready: The crop is ready to be harvested

If the weather is good, the crops will grow one stage. If the weather is bad, the crops will not grow.

## End of the game

The number of harvested crops required to win is the number of players multiplied by 3.
The players win the game if they harvest enough crops to survive the winter.
The game ends after 10 rounds.
