# Homestead

The players must work together to plant and harvest enough crops to survive the winter. If the players can collect enough food tokens by the end of the game, they win!

## You will need:

- Game board, consistent of a 5x5 grid of spaces
- Player tokens (one for each player)
- Crop tokens to represent the crops that are planted (dice can be used as crop tokens)
- one six-sided dice

## Gameplay

Players start by placing their tokens on the game the board.
The game is divided into rounds, and each round consists of every player taking a turn.

- When it's a player's turn, they roll a die to determine how many spaces they can move their token around the board. They can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
- A player cannot finish their turn on a space that is already occupied by another player's token.
- Once per turn, a player can choose to
  - Plant: plants up to two crops on spaces that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) to their token. Place a counter on that space to represent the crop.
  - Harvest: any fully grown crop the player moves through this turn is harvested. Harvested crops go into the players' food pile, and the crop counter is removed from the board.
  - Water: any crop the player moves through this turn is watered. Watered crops grow one stage.
  - If a player rolls a 6 on their turn, they can plant and harvest in the same turn.

## Weather & Crop Growth

Once every turn is complete, roll a dice, on a roll of 1-4, the weather is good and all crops grow normally. On a roll of 5-6, the weather is bad and crops do not grow.
The crop growth cycle is as follows:

- Sown: The crop has been planted this round
- Growing: The crop has started to grow
- Ready: The crop is ready to be harvested

If the weather is good, the crops will grow one stage. If the weather is bad, the crops will not grow.

## End of the game

The players win the game if they harvest enough crops to survive the winter, before the game ends after 5 rounds.
The number of harvested crops required to win is the number of players multiplied by 4.
